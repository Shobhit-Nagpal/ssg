# About

This repo is practice for making a static site generator using Python. It's part of a guided project from [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev/)

I will be remaking this in Golang and potentially TypeScript (which is then published as an npm package)

# Usage

If you wish to try out the static site generator, follow the steps below:

### Clone repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shobhit-Nagpal/ssg
```

### Run main script
```bash
./main.sh
```

You can write content in the content directory under markdown file
